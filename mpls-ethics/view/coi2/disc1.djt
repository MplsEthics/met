<p>
M.C.O. §15.40 is an ordinance that prohibits the City’s officials from
participating in any particular matter of City business that directly or
indirectly affects their financial interests or the financial interests of
other persons or entities that are attributed to them under the ordinance,
e.g., their spouses and employers.

<p>
The Ethics Code recognizes that the citizens who serve on the City’s boards
and commissions are citizens of other callings who devote only a part of
their lives to the service of the City.  One who engages in such service to
the City is not thereby deprived of the ordinary rights of citizenship.  A
member can not be disqualified from submitting to the jurisdiction of the
Board, as all other citizens and property owners of the City are required
to do in similar situations.  But some consideration must be given to how
the matter is handled by you and the other members of the board.

<p>
Conflict of interest situations are fact sensitive and determinations of
conflict of interest must be done on a case-by-case basis.   As the chair
of the Board of Appeals, you are designated a local official by M.C.O.
§15.280(m)(3).  The maintenance order you received from the inspections
department will affect your financial interests, directly or indirectly.
Participation under M.C.O. §15.40(b)(1) is defined broadly.  Participation
includes providing advice, a recommendation, debating, sponsoring.

<p>
M.C.O. §15.40 requires you to disclose the conflict of financial interest
to the other members of the board as soon as you become aware of the
conflict, e.g. at the point you decide to appeal the order.  Your
disclosure needs to be in writing on the conflict of interest form.  The
completed form will be distributed to the other members of the board, the
mayor and city council, as well as any department heads whose departments
could be affected and filed with the City Clerk.
