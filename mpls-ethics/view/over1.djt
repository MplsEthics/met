<h1>Overview Of the Ethics in Government Ordinances</h1>

<p>
The Ethics in Government Code, Chapter 15 of the Minneapolis Code of
Ordinances, was enacted in 2002 to promote confidence and trust in the
integrity of City Government. The Code:

<ul>
<li>Establishes a code of conduct for the Cityâ€™s elected officials,
appointed officials and employees</li>
<li>Provides for the filing of financial disclosure statements (Statements
of economic interest) by many City officials and employees
<li>Created the Ethical Practices Board and the position of Ethics Officer
to administer the Ethics in Government Code</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Code has two types of ordinance sections&mdash;aspiration and rule
sections:

<ul>
<li>Ethical aspiration sections represent the inspirational objectives
toward which each local official and employee should strive.</li>
<li>Rule sections set forth some specific standards below which no City
official or employee can fall without being subject to disciplinary action.
These rules are considered a baseline of conduct and some departments have
adopted more stringent rules.</li>
</ul>
