<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>
The ethics education in which you participated today is a summary of the
ethics code provisions commonly encountered by citizens appointed to City
boards and commissions.  Our goal was not to make you a legal expert but to
give you an understanding of conflicts of interest, impermissible disclosure
of information and prohibited gifts and an appreciation of why these rules are
necessary for good governance.

<p>
There are many ethics topics we did not cover.  We encourage you to review
the <a target="new" href="http://www.minneapolismn.gov/epb/epb_ordinance">
Ethics Code</a> and the <a target="new"
href="http://www.minneapolismn.gov/epb/">Ethical Practices Board
website</a>.
Downloadable <a target="new"
href="http://www.minneapolismn.gov/epb/epb_coi-forms">conflict of interest
forms</a> are available on the Ethical Practices Board website for board and
commission members.  These are the forms you should use to disclose a
potential conflict of interest.

<p>
If you have any ethics questions, please contact the Cityâ€™s Ethics Officer,
Susan Trammell at <a href="mailto:EthicsOfficer@minneapolismn.gov">
EthicsOfficer@minneapolismn.gov</a> or 612-673-3230.

<p>
Please remember that you may report a violation of the Ethics in Government
Code by contacting the Ethics Officer, accessing the <a target="new"
