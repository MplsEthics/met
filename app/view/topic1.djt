You may not participate in a particular matter of City business if you have
a financial interest in the matter.

Participate includes making the decision, taking action, entering into a
transaction, providing advice or a recommendation, introducing, sponsoring,
debating, voting on, approving, and investigating the decision, action, or
transaction.  Participate is more than is official responsibility,
knowledge, perfunctory involvement, or involvement on an administrative or
peripheral basis.  A financial interest is any interest, including loans,
which shall yield, directly or indirectly, a monetary or other material
benefit.  Financial interest includes ownership of bonds or publicly traded
securities with a market value of $2,500 or more.  The financial interest
also includes the financial interests of your employer, your associated
businesses, your spouse, domestic partner and/or dependents and their
employers and associated businesses.  M.C.O. 15.40.
