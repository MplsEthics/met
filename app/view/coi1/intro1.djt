<p>
There are four discussion topics in this training.  The first discussion
topic is <em>Conflict of Interest</em>.

<p>
Remember, we encourage you to use the analysis steps discussed earlier to
select answers to the scenarios.

<p>
As with some of the other rules, the conflict of interest rule is complex
and we will discuss only the highlights in this training.  We urge you to
take some time to read the entire rule at your convenience.

<p>
<em>General Rule</em> You may not participate in a particular matter of City
business if you have a financial interest in the matter.

<p>
<b>Participate</b> includes making the decision, taking action, entering
into a transaction, providing advice or a recommendation, introducing,
sponsoring, debating, voting on, approving, and investigating the decision,
action, or transaction.  Participate is more than is official
responsibility, knowledge, perfunctory involvement, or involvement on an
administrative or peripheral basis.

<p>
A <b>financial interest</b> is any interest, including loans, which shall
yield, directly or indirectly, a monetary or other material benefit.
Financial interest includes ownership of bonds or publicly traded
securities with a market value of $2,500 or more.  The financial interest
also includes the financial interests of your employer, your associated
businesses, your spouse, domestic partner and/or dependents and their
employers and associated businesses.  M.C.O. 15.40.

<p>
<em>Reflection:</em> If you have a personal stake in an official decision, is
your decision based on your best interest or your agencyâ€™s best interest?
