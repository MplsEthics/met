M.C.O. §15.40 is an ordinance that prohibits the City’s officials from participating in any particular matter of City business that directly or indirectly affects their financial interests or the financial interests of other persons or entities that are attributed to them under the ordinance, e.g., their spouses and employers.
The Ethics Code recognizes that the citizens who serve on the City’s boards and commissions are citizens of other callings who devote only a part of their lives to the service of the City.  One who engages in such service to the City is not thereby deprived of the ordinary rights of citizenship.  A member can not be disqualified from submitting to the jurisdiction of the Board, as all other citizens and property owners of the City are required to do in similar situations.  But some consideration must be given to how the matter is handled by you and the other members of the board.
Conflict of interest situations are fact sensitive and determinations of conflict of interest must be done on a case-by-case basis.   As the chair of the Board of Appeals, you are designated a local official by M.C.O. §15.280(m)(3).  The maintenance order you received from the inspections department will affect your financial interests, directly or indirectly.   Participation under M.C.O. §15.40(b)(1) is defined broadly.  Participation includes providing advice, a recommendation, debating, sponsoring.
M.C.O. §15.40 requires you to disclose the conflict of financial interest to the other members of the board as soon as you become aware of the conflict, e.g. at the point you decide to appeal the order.  Your disclosure needs to be in writing on the conflict of interest form.  The completed form will be distributed to the other members of the board, the mayor and city council, as well as any department heads whose departments could be affected and filed with the City Clerk.

Discussion continued:
Because you are the Chair of the Board, you control the discussion of an agenda item.  When the Board considers a matter in which you have a financial interest, you must turn the chair over to the vice chair, and not participate in any manner in the Board’s proceedings.
Once you have a matter to be discussed by the Board on which you serve, you must carefully avoid ex parte discussions with the other Board members.  Even without knowing any of the facts of your matter, some members may recuse themselves because their relationship with you may appear to have impaired independence of their judgment.  If the matter is highly contentious or the remaining Board members are not able to or have concerns about acting on another member’s matter, the affected City Department may work with the Board and seek the assistance of an administrative law judge.

Discussion continued:
Situations where members appear on their own behalf are distinguishable from situations where members appear on behalf of clients in a matter before the board.
Ethics Code § 15.60(a) precludes a local official from accepting employment or entering into a contract that interferes with the discharge of the local official’s public duty or creates a conflict of interest that would materially impair the local official’s ability to serve the City.  Ethics Code § 15.70 prohibits a local official from using his or her official position to solicit privileges or special treatment.
By taking on a client’s business, when that business will likely appear on a board agenda, a local official voluntarily creates a financial interest which may conflict with the duties owed to the citizens of the City.  Citizens may view the local official’s involvement as influence peddling or taking advantage of the “inside track”.  Even if the local official abstains from the matter, the objectivity of other members may be questioned due to the local official’s “control”  or “influence” over other board members.  Inside tracks and influence peddling are rightly viewed by citizens as adverse to the public interest and will erode public confidence and trust.  A local official should carefully consider their position on the board before agreeing to take on a client when that client’s business will likely appear at some point on the board’s agenda.
