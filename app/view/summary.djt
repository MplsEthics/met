<h1>SUMMARY</h1>

{# FIXME: need to verify that these links are correct #}

<p>
The ethics education in which you participated today is a summary of the
ethics code provisions commonly encountered by citizens appointed to City
boards and commissions.  Our goal was not to make you a legal expert but to
give you an understanding of conflicts of interest, impermissible disclosure
of information and prohibited gifts and an appreciation of why these rules are
necessary for good governance.

<p>
There are many ethics topics we did not cover.  We encourage you to review the
Ethics Code at
<a href="http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/epb/docs/CodeofEthicsOrd.pdf">
www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/epb/docs/CodeofEthicsOrd.pdf</a>
and the Ethical Practices Board website at
<a href="http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/epb/">
www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/epb</a>.
Available on the Ethical Practices Board website is a downloadable conflict of
interest form for board and commission members,
<a href="http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/council/procedures/docs/Conflict-of-Interest-Form.doc">www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/council/procedures/docs/Conflict-of-Interest-Form.doc</a>.  This is the form you
should use to disclose a potential conflict of interest.

<p>
