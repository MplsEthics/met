SUMMARY

The ethics education in which you participated today is a summary of the
ethics code provisions commonly encountered by citizens appointed to City
boards and commissions.  Our goal was not to make you a legal expert but to
give you an understanding of conflicts of interest, impermissible
disclosure of information and prohibited gifts and an appreciation of why
these rules are necessary for good governance.

There are many ethics topics we did not cover.  We encourage you to review
the Ethics Code, LINK, and the Ethical Practices Board website, LINK.
Available on the Ethical Practices Board website is a downloadable conflict
of interest form for board and commission members, LINK.  This is the form
you should use to disclose a potential conflict of interest.

If you have any ethics questions, please contact the Cityâ€™s Ethics Officer,
Susan Trammell at EthicsOfficer@ci.minneapolis.mn.us or 612-673-3230.

Please remember that you may report a violation of the Ethics in Government
Code by contacting the Ethics Officer, accessing the Ethics Report Line web
reporting feature at

downloadable complaint form from the Ethical Practices Board website,
