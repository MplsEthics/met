<p>
Gifts to City officials pose a couple of risks.  One risk is that a gift will
actually influence the official’s action on a matter.  The other risk is that
the public will perceive the gift as having influenced the official’s action
on the matter, regardless of whether the matter was actually influenced.

<p>
There is reason to be concerned with even small gifts.  Officials may
rationalize that it is perfectly okay to accept such a small gift because
everyone knows you can not be bought for a scone and coffee.  Sometimes that
is the start of a very gradual but slippery slope.

<p>
When you are confronted with a gift from a prohibited source, you will want to
consider carefully that even when a gift exception would allow you to accept
the gift that it is never inappropriate and is frequently prudent to decline
the gift because of your official position.

<p>
It is difficult to decline a gift especially when the only apparent reason for
the giving of the gift is thoughtfulness.  A gift can be gracefully declined.
Start with thanking the giver for the giver’s thoughtfulness.  You can explain
the City’s gift policy and say “no thank you” as graciously as one can.  You
may wish to use words to the effect… “I appreciate your offer of this gift,
but I can not accept it.  Your effort to [thank me] [to be considerate] is so
very kind and thoughtful.  Your gesture makes my day.  It is important that
the City’s citizens not come to believe or perceive that they are required to
give gifts in order to receive a high level or service from the City so I must
respectfully decline your offer.”
