GENERAL RULE: You may not solicit or accept any gift from an interested person, lobbyist, or principal who has a direct financial interest in a decision that you are authorized to make.
A gift is defined as money, real or personal property, a service, a loan, a forbearance or forgiveness of indebtedness, or a promise of future employment, that is given and received without the fiver receiving consideration of equal or greater value in return.
A lobbyist is an individual engaged for pay or other consideration, or authorized to spend money by another source, or an individual who spends more $250.00 in any year, for the purpose of attempting to influence legislative or administrative action, or other city action, by communicating or urging others to communicate with public or local officials.
A principal is an individual or association that either spends more than $500.00 in the aggregate in any calendar year to engage a lobbyist, compensate a lobbyist, or authorize the expenditure of money by a lobbyist; or spends a total of at least fifty $50,000.00 in any calendar year on efforts to influence city council action, administrative action, or other city action.
An interested person is a person or a representative of a person or association that has a direct financial interest in a decision that a local official or employee is authorized to make
A limited number of exceptions to the general rule exist.  The exceptions include a service to assist you in the performance of your official duties; a service of insignificant monetary value; a plaque or similar memento with a resale value of $5 or less, a trinket or memento costing $5 or less; a gift from a family member even though the family member is a lobbyist, principal or interested person; and gifts to qualified groups.

SCENARIO:  You are a member of the Minneapolis Advisory Committee on People with Disabilities.  Each member has been tasked with inspecting the City’s restaurants and hotels for accessibility purposes.  When you arrive at Hotel, staff tells you that the General Manager is running a bit late, asks you to have a seat in the lobby and offers you a scone and coffee while you wait for the General Manager.

QUESTION:  Is it permissible to accept the scone and coffee?
REFLECTION:  How might it appear to a third party if you accept a gift from a prohibited source, even if you are properly accepting the gift under a listed exception?
Remember, we encourage you to use the analysis steps discussed earlier to select answers to the scenarios.

QUESTION:  Is it permissible to accept the scone and coffee?


Yes, because the intent behind the offer was one of common courtesy.
Yes, because the value of the scone and coffee is less than $5.00.
No, because your inspection could have an impact on the Hotel’s financial interests.
Yes, because the offer was from staff not from the General Manager.

Discussion:
Incorrect.  It may well be that the gift is offered simply as a common courtesy with no intention to influence your inspection but if the gift is from a prohibited source, the gift must fall under an exception in order to be accepted.

Discussion:
Incorrect.  Not all gifts valued under $5.00 may be accepted.  This gift would not fit under any of the exceptions so even though it is of minimal value it may not be accepted if it is from a prohibited source.

Correct!!  The Hotel is an interested party.  The Hotel has a financial interest in the outcome of your inspection.  Should you report a deficiency, the Hotel will need to spend time and money to contest or remedy the deficiency.

No exceptions apply to a gift of scone and coffee as described in the scenario.  Food and beverage are never considered “services” or “trinkets or mementos”.  There is an exception that specifically addresses gifts of food or beverages, but it is quite limited in its application to event at which the recipient appears to make a speech or answer questions as part of a program.

Gifts to City officials pose a couple of risks.  One risk is that a gift will actually influence the official’s action on a matter.  The other risk is that the public will perceive the gift as having influenced the official’s action on the matter, regardless of whether the matter was actually influenced.

There is reason to be concerned with even small gifts.  Officials may rationalize that it is perfectly okay to accept such a small gift because everyone knows you can not be bought for a scone and coffee.  Sometimes that is the start of a very gradual but slippery slope.
When you are confronted with a gift from a prohibited source, you will want to consider carefully that even when a gift exception would allow you to accept the gift that it is never inappropriate and is frequently prudent to decline the gift because of your official position.
