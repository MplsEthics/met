<h2>Ethics Report Line Continued:</h2>

<p>
What happens when you call the Ethics Report Line?

<ol>
<li>Your call is answered by a specially trained interviewer who documents
your concern in detail. Your call is not recorded and you may remain
anonymous.
<li>The interviewer gives you a report number and a call back date.
<li>The company relays information about your concern to the appropriate City
staff member for follow-up or investigation.
<li>You phone the Ethics Report Line on your scheduled call back date and give
the operator your report number. At this time, an interviewer may ask you a
few questions to clarify the issue or give you an update on the status of the
investigation.
<li>If you wish, you can always call back to provide additional information or
to ask about the status of the investigation. (Be sure to have your report
number on hand.)
</ol>

<p>
The Networkâ€™s Web-based report service works in a similar fashion. The Web
site visitor is guided through a series of online questions designed to elicit
the same information the interviewer would gather.
