GENERAL RULE: You may not use or disclose any information gained in the course of or by reason of service to the City in any way that violates either your fiduciary duty to the City or the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act.  In addition, you may not use or disclose privileged, nonpublic, confidential, private, or proprietary information gained in the course of your official duties in any way that could result in financial gain for you, or for your spouse, domestic partner, or dependent, or for a person in a committed relationship with you, or for any associated business of these persons. M.C.O. § 15.170.
SCENARIO:  You are a member of the Rental Housing Board of Appeals.  Last year in the course of your service on the Board, you ruled on the suspension of Landlord’s rental license.  From the review of Landlord’s file you learned that Complainant was the source of the initial complaint forming the basis for the suspension of the rental license.  Last week you were at a friend’s party and starting chatting with Guest.  Guest was telling you about her rental properties and mentioned Complainant.  Guest’s rental properties are located in the same neighborhood as Landlord’s property.  According to Guest, Complainant is always calling Guest and threatening to file a complaint about the condition of her rental properties.  You warn Guest that Complainant will likely follow through with such threat and explain what happened when Complainant filed a complaint about Landlord.

Incorrect.  The discussion you are holding with Guest could require you to recuse yourself from a later hearing involving Guest’s properties but has no bearing on whether your disclosure of the information involving Landlord was proper.

Discussion:

Correct!!  The Minnesota Government Data Practices Act classifies the identity of a Complainant as private data on an individual.  This means that the although the data is accessible to the Complainant, the data not accessible to the public.

Discussion:

Members of the City’s boards and commissions will encounter non-public data through their work for the City.  It is important to keep the information non-public.  Even when you are not financially gaining from information, disclosure or use of non-public data that violate your fiduciary duty to the City and/or the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (“MGDPA”) violates the Ethics Code.  In addition to being an Ethics Code violation, a disclosure violating the MGDPA can result in legal actions by the subject of the data.  And a willful violation can result in exemplary damages of not less than $100, nor more than $10,000 for each violation.

It is important to take care to protect the non-public data you encounter in your role as a member of a City board or commission.  Occasionally, but not often, status of data changes based upon the status of a matter.  Always ask your staff liaison for assistance should you have any questions about the status of data.
