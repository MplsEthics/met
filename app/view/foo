Overview:  Ethics Report Line

As government employees and officials, the public rightly expects us to always exhibit the highest level of integrity.  Unfortunately, any instance of wrongdoing taints good employees and officials by association.  Wrongdoing harms the City’s image and reduces our ability to accomplish our mission.  Wrongdoing also can result in serious personal and professional consequences for an employee, including discipline, job loss or even imprisonment.  Local officials can be removed from their positions.  Additionally, the City of Minneapolis could face costly lawsuits as a result of wrongdoing by one of its employees or local officials.
If you’re aware of an illegal or unethical activity, don’t ignore it. If possible, say something to the person.  If the situation doesn’t improve or you don’t feel comfortable talking to the person, you can:
call the Ethics Report Line at 1-877-563-1075
visit the Ethics Report Line Web site, or
contact the City’s Ethics Officer, Susan Trammell, at (612) 673-3230 or susan.trammell@ci.minneapolis.mn.us.

Ethics Report Line
The Ethics Report Line is operated by an independent company — The Network — to ensure a confidential process for City employees and officials to report workplace concerns such as:
Violations of government regulations
Violations of the City’s Ethics in Government policy
Destroying, altering or falsifying City records
Withholding properly requested public records
Theft or fraud
Creating or ignoring safety or environmental hazards
Using or selling illegal drugs
Misuse of City property or facilities
Alcohol use while on duty
Bribery
Conflict of interest
Threats to personal safety
Accounting or auditing irregularities
Harassment, discrimination or other violations of the City’s Respect in the Workplace policy.
The Network provides anonymous reporting services for hundreds of businesses and governmental entities worldwide.
Ethics Report Line Continued:

What happens when you call the Ethics Report Line?

1.Your call is answered by a specially trained interviewer who documents your concern in detail. Your call is not recorded and you may remain anonymous.
2.The interviewer gives you a report number and a call back date.
3.The company relays information about your concern to the appropriate City staff member for follow-up or investigation.
4.You phone the Ethics Report Line on your scheduled call back date and give the operator your report number. At this time, an interviewer may ask you a few questions to clarify the issue or give you an update on the status of the investigation.
5.If you wish, you can always call back to provide additional information or to ask about the status of the investigation. (Be sure to have your report number on hand.)

The Network’s Web-based report service works in a similar fashion. The Web site visitor is guided through a series of online questions designed to elicit the same information the interviewer would gather.

Ethics in Government Education for Appointed Members of Boards, Commissions and Agencies

Office of the Minneapolis City Attorney

Welcome to the Ethics in Government Education for Appointed Members of Boards, Commissions and Agencies.  This training module consists of a General Overview of the City of Minneapolis Ethics in Government Ordinance, followed by three discussion topics, an overview of the Ethics Report Line, and a summary.  The discussion topics are as follows:

1.Conflict of Interest
2.Disclosure of Information
3.Gifts

We expect that, on average, this training should take approximately 40 minutes.  Upon completion, you will have finished your required ethics education for the four year time period and will be more comfortable with some of the measures to ensure integrity in Minneapolis City government.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING YOUR TRAINING

STEP ONE: We begin each topic with a “general” rule. You should reflect for a brief moment on how that rule furthers the purpose of the Ethics in Government Ordinance -- to promote high ethical standards and conduct, and to foster a healthy ethical culture throughout city government.
STEP TWO: Following the general rule will be a scenario and a question. Please choose the best answer from among the possible answers.
To choose the best answer, think first what the answer should be based simply on the general rule. Then ask yourself, "Is there a good reason in this case not to apply the general rule?" In other words, should there be an exception here? Balance the apparent good that the general rule might do in this case against any competing values that you believe may be important.
STEP THREE: After you select an answer, give particular attention to our explanation of why the answer is correct or incorrect. Only at this stage, when you have read our explanation, will you know if an exception actually applies to the general rule that we gave you at the beginning of the scenario. Reflect on the difference, if any, between what you thought the correct answer should be and what it actually was. Once you are confident that you understand the rationale for the correct answer, go on to the next scenario.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING YOUR TRAINING

Applying ethics rules are more complex than you would think. Your good intentions and a basic understanding of the more common rules may not be enough to protect you from committing inadvertent violations. Of course, as several people commented during previous training, it is never inappropriate to take a cautious approach and say "No," even when an exception may allow you to take a certain action.
It is surprising how many well-intentioned personnel have unintentionally broken the rules because they just didn't realize there was a problem until it was too late. In a training session such as this, we can't present you with all ethics rules and their exceptions, much less expect you to remember them. What we can do is orient you to a way of thinking that readily identifies potential ethics problems so that you know whether you need to seek specific guidance before engaging in an activity. We believe that using the three steps outlined above will give you the proper orientation by asking you to focus on general ethical principles and their relation to real-life situations.
STEP FOUR: At the end of the training, you will be linked to an automated training completion certificate and email.  You are encouraged to save a copy of the completion certificate for your own records.  You should use the email to notify the City Clerk’s office and your city staff liaison of your completion of this educational requirement.

Electronic records of training are not transmitted back to the Office of the Minneapolis City Attorney or the city department staffing your board, commission or agency and we are not able to assist you in reproducing proof that you’ve completed this training.  If you do not make a copy of your certificate, the only method available for obtaining another certificate is to re-take this course in its entirety.

Let's get started with an overview of the Ethics in Government Ordinance.
Overview Of the
Ethics in Government Ordinances

HISTORY:  (Review JIM/CAROL/BURT videos)  The Ethics in Government Code was enacted in 2002 to promote confidence in City Government. The Code:
Establishes a code of conduct for the City’s elected officials, appointed officials and employees
Provides for the filing of financial disclosure statements (Statements of economic interest) by many City officials and employees
Created the Ethical Practices Board to administer the Ethics in Government Code
The Ordinance sets forth some specific standards below which no City official or employee should violate and, as importantly, sets forth aspirations for ethical conduct that go above and beyond the minimum requirements of the Ordinance
Aspirations:
Principals to which we aspire.
The Mission
Code of Ethics is an important means of conveying the principles of our organization to employees, officials, volunteers and the public.  Our responsibility to the public
 Helping to to Preserve Public Trust in the Integrity of City Government.
For government to operate properly, each city official and employee must earn and honor the public trust by integrity and conduct.
Rules
Establish the baseline of conduct for city officials and employees

Overview Of the
Ethics in Government Ordinance

Ethical Practices Board

The Minneapolis Ethical Practices Board is an independent board whose three members are appointed by the Chief Judge of Hennepin County, the Dean of the University of St. Thomas Law School and the Dean of the University of Minnesota Law School.  Ethical Practices Board members must be Minneapolis citizens who are not related to any city officials or employees.  The Ethical Practices Board may conduct hearings and issue advisory opinions as applicable under the ordinance.
You may desire a determination of whether your own conduct or anticipated conduct conforms to or violates the Ethics in Government Ordinance.  You may seek an informal non-binding opinion from the Ethics Officer.  You may also seek a binding determination by requesting an advisory opinion from the Ethical Practices Board.
You may desire a determination of whether the conduct of elected officials, employees and citizens appointed to serve on the City’s boards and commissions conforms to or violated the Ethics in Government Ordinances.  Complaints may be filed with the Ethics Officer or through the Ethics Report Line.  A complaint regarding an employee’s (other than Department Heads) ethical violation is referred to the employee’s department for investigation and disciplinary proceedings.  The Ethical Practices Board investigates and conducts hearings when a complaint is filed alleging an ethics violation by a Department Head, elected official or a citizen appointed to serve on one of the City’s boards and commissions.
In the event a complaint alleging you violated of the Ethics in Government rules, the Ethical Practices Board would investigate and take evidence in a fact finding hearing.  A recommendation is made to the appointing authority regarding the complaint should it be sustained.
There are four discussion topics in this training.  The first discussion topic is
Conflict of Interest
Remember, we encourage you to use the analysis steps discussed earlier to select answers to the scenarios.
As with some of the other rules, the conflict of interest rule is detailed (complex) and we will discuss only the highlights in this training.  We urge you to take some time to read the entire rule at your convenience.
GENERAL RULE: You may not participate in a particular matter of City business if you have a financial interest in the matter.
Participate includes making the decision, taking action, entering into a transaction, providing advice or a recommendation, introducing, sponsoring, debating, voting on, approving, and investigating the decision, action, or transaction.  Participate is more than is official responsibility, knowledge, perfunctory involvement, or involvement on an administrative or peripheral basis.  A financial interest is any interest, including loans, which shall yield, directly or indirectly, a monetary or other material benefit.  Financial interest includes ownership of bonds or publicly traded securities with a market value of $2,500 or more.  The financial interest also includes the financial interests of your employer, your associated businesses, your spouse, domestic partner and/or dependents and their employers and associated businesses.  M.C.O. 15.40.
REFLECTION:  If you have a personal stake in an official decision, is your decision based on your best interest or your agency’s best interest?

Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part One
SCENARIO: You, an architect, arrive for a Zoning Board of Adjustment meeting only to see a “Friend” standing in the hallway outside the meeting room.  Friend is present to plead his case for a variance.  Many neighborhood residents appearing to oppose Friend’s case are also standing in the hallway.  You “backslap” your friend with a hearty greeting.  Your employer initially worked on Friend’s project but Friend chose to finish the project with another Firm.  You never worked on Friend’s project because you specialize in other areas.
QUESTION: May you participate in the Board’s decision related to Friend’s variance?
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part One
QUESTION: May you participate in the Board’s decision related to Friend’s variance?
Please reflect first on the reason we have this conflict of interest statute and how it applies here. Then choose the best answer.
  Yes.  You may participate if your employer has no direct or indirect financial interest.
  Yes.  You may participate if you disclose the relationships to the other members of the Board prior to the action being taken.
  Yes.  You may participate because your employer is not involved and you are not related to Friend.
  No.  You may not participate because of your relationship with Friend.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part One

Discussion:

Correct!!
Your employer’s financial interests are considered your financial interests.  If your employer has no business relationship with the party appearing before the Board, your employer, and you, have no financial interest in the matter.
You may now proceed to the next page for a full discussion of the issue.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part One
Discussion:
Incorrect.  Disclosure of a conflict of interest does not permit you to participate in a matter in which you have a conflict.  If your employer has a financial interest in the matter, then you are considered to have a conflict of interest and may not participate in the decision on Friend’s variance.
Please return to the question and select another answer.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part One
Discussion:
Incorrect.  This answer would be correct only if your Friend and your Employer have concluded all business between them, including payment of outstanding bills.
There is a better answer, please try again.
Please return to the question and select another answer.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part One
Discussion:
Incorrect.  Financial interests of friends are not considered your financial interests, so your relationship with Friend would not preclude you from hearing the matter.
Please return to the question and select another answer.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part One
Discussion:
M.C.O. §15.40 is an ordinance that prohibits the City’s officials from participating in any particular matter of City business that directly or indirectly affects their financial interests or the financial interests of other persons or entities that are attributed to them under the ordinance, e.g., their spouses and employers.
Determining whether a conflict of interest is present requires an analysis on a case-by-case and fact sensitive basis. As a member of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, you are designated a local official by M.C.O. §15.280(m)(3).  Voting on the variance appeal is considered participation under M.C.O. §15.40(b)(1).  The variance appeal might have a direct or indirect affect on your employer’s financial interests if Friend and your Employer have unconcluded business or a continuing business relationship.  There are many ways in which Friend and Employer financial interests could be affected by the Boards decision, e.g. bills remain to be paid and Friend will not have funds to pay bills if the variance is not granted.  Only once you determine that business dealings between Employer and Friend are entirely concluded will your Employer have no financial interest in the variance appeal.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part One
Discussion continued:
Your relationship with Friend does not create a financial conflict of interest since the Ethics Code does not consider the financial interests of your friends to be your financial interests.  Only your financial interests and those of your employers and associated businesses, along with the financial interests of your dependents, your spouse or domestic partner and their employers and associated businesses are considered your financial interests.  Your friends’ financial interests would not be considered your financial interests.
Since Friend’s financial interests are not your financial interests, you may be saying to yourself, “This is easy!  I know the rule, there is no problem here.  I can vote on this variance appeal.”
Or… you might be thinking “Maybe I should not have greeted Friend so enthusiastically. What are his neighbors thinking?”  The public tends to be cynical about government, and may not realize that you only want to do what is best for the City of Minneapolis.  What might be best for the City might not be what is best for Friend’s neighbors.  Attitudes, behavior and attention to details can impact how citizens feel about City government.
The best policy is to disclose your relationship with Friend even though the Ethics Code does not require disclosure.  And because of the hearty greeting, you may wish to recuse yourself from the matter so as to avoid the appearance of favoritism to your Friend.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Two
SCENARIO:  You are the chair of the Housing Board of Appeal which hears and acts upon appeals brought forth by property owners or responsible parties for a property that has received orders defining a violation of the Housing Maintenance Code.  You received an order from a housing inspector regarding a rental property you own.  You want to appeal the order.
QUESTION:   May you appeal an order issued by city staff when the appeal will be heard by a board on which you are a member?
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Two
QUESTION: May you appeal an order issued by city staff when the appeal will be heard by a board on which you are a member?
Please reflect first on the reason we have this conflict of interest statute and how it applies here. Then choose the best answer.
 Yes.  Provided you send a property representative and not personally plead your case to the board.
 Yes. Provided you resign from the Board prior to the hearing date.
 Yes.  Provided you do not discuss your situation with other board members outside of the hearing.
 No.  Because of your relationship to the board, whether you resign or not.

Discussion:

Correct!!  You continue to have the rights other citizens have to pursue personal business with the City and may appeal a housing order to the Board.

Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Two
Discussion:
Incorrect.  This answer leaves you with no recourse and denies you rights held by other Minneapolis citizens.

Please return to the question and select another answer.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Two
Discussion:

M.C.O. §15.40 is an ordinance that prohibits the City’s officials from participating in any particular matter of City business that directly or indirectly affects their financial interests or the financial interests of other persons or entities that are attributed to them under the ordinance, e.g., their spouses and employers.
The Ethics Code recognizes that the citizens who serve on the City’s boards and commissions are citizens of other callings who devote only a part of their lives to the service of the City.  One who engages in such service to the City is not thereby deprived of the ordinary rights of citizenship.  A member can not be disqualified from submitting to the jurisdiction of the Board, as all other citizens and property owners of the City are required to do in similar situations.  But some consideration must be given to how the matter is handled by you and the other members of the board.
Conflict of interest situations are fact sensitive and determinations of conflict of interest must be done on a case-by-case basis.   As the chair of the Board of Appeals, you are designated a local official by M.C.O. §15.280(m)(3).  The maintenance order you received from the inspections department will affect your financial interests, directly or indirectly.   Participation under M.C.O. §15.40(b)(1) is defined broadly.  Participation includes providing advice, a recommendation, debating, sponsoring.
M.C.O. §15.40 requires you to disclose the conflict of financial interest to the other members of the board as soon as you become aware of the conflict, e.g. at the point you decide to appeal the order.  Your disclosure needs to be in writing on the conflict of interest form.  The completed form will be distributed to the other members of the board, the mayor and city council, as well as any department heads whose departments could be affected and filed with the City Clerk.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Two
Discussion continued:
Because you are the Chair of the Board, you control the discussion of an agenda item.  When the Board considers a matter in which you have a financial interest, you must turn the chair over to the vice chair, and not participate in any manner in the Board’s proceedings.
Once you have a matter to be discussed by the Board on which you serve, you must carefully avoid ex parte discussions with the other Board members.  Even without knowing any of the facts of your matter, some members may recuse themselves because their relationship with you may appear to have impaired independence of their judgment.  If the matter is highly contentious or the remaining Board members are not able to or have concerns about acting on another member’s matter, the affected City Department may work with the Board and seek the assistance of an administrative law judge.

Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Two
Discussion continued:
Situations where members appear on their own behalf are distinguishable from situations where members appear on behalf of clients in a matter before the board.
Ethics Code § 15.60(a) precludes a local official from accepting employment or entering into a contract that interferes with the discharge of the local official’s public duty or creates a conflict of interest that would materially impair the local official’s ability to serve the City.  Ethics Code § 15.70 prohibits a local official from using his or her official position to solicit privileges or special treatment.
By taking on a client’s business, when that business will likely appear on a board agenda, a local official voluntarily creates a financial interest which may conflict with the duties owed to the citizens of the City.  Citizens may view the local official’s involvement as influence peddling or taking advantage of the “inside track”.  Even if the local official abstains from the matter, the objectivity of other members may be questioned due to the local official’s “control”  or “influence” over other board members.  Inside tracks and influence peddling are rightly viewed by citizens as adverse to the public interest and will erode public confidence and trust.  A local official should carefully consider their position on the board before agreeing to take on a client when that client’s business will likely appear at some point on the board’s agenda.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Three
SCENARIO:  A charge of discrimination has been filed by one of the former employees of Make Money Company.  The Chair of the Civil Rights Commission has informed you that you are on the panel assigned to hear the case.  You own $15,000 worth of stock in Make Money Company and your daughter is an executive with the company in a division not involved in the charge of discrimination.
QUESTION: May you sit on the panel hearing the charge of discrimination?
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Three
QUESTION: May you sit on the panel hearing the charge of discrimination?
Please reflect first on the reason we have this conflict of interest statute and how it applies here. Then choose the best answer.
Yes. You can hear this case because you have a high level of integrity and can assure the Chair that you will not let your stock ownership and your daughter’s employment influence you in making decisions on this case.
Maybe, if you sell the stock and determine that your relationship with your daughter and her employment will not affect your decisions in the case.
No, because your financial interest in the stock and your daughter’s employment preclude you from hearing the case.
Yes, if you sell your stock and disown your daughter.

Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Three


Discussion:
Incorrect.  The fact that you are an honest person with a high level of personal integrity is not relevant.
The ordinance provides objective criteria.  The subjective factor of personal integrity is not included.  The fact that you could make an objective and impartial decision based entirely on the facts presented in the hearing would not preclude you from violating the conflict of interest rule.
This is a good example of how even honest, well-meaning individuals may unwittingly violate the Ethics Code.
Please return to the question and select another answer.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Three


Discussion:

Correct!!
Selling the stock would eliminate your conflicting financial interest.
Your ability to assume the responsibilities of a member of the hearing panel would then depend on whether of not your participation in the matter would lead to an appearance of impropriety.
You may now proceed to a next page for a full discussion of the issue.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Three


Discussion:
Incorrect.  While stock ownership does give you a financial interest that precludes you from serving on the hearing panel, there are actions that may be taken to remedy the conflict and allow you to participate.
There is a better answer, please try again.
Please return to the question and select another answer.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Three


Discussion:
Did you really think the City would require you to disown your child?
We’ve been accused of being heartless – but never like this.
There is a better answer, please try again.
Please return to the question and select another answer.

Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Three

Discussion:
M.C.O. §15.40 is an ordinance that prohibits the City’s officials from participating in any particular matter of City business that directly or indirectly affects their financial interests or the financial interests of other persons or entities that are attributed to them under the ordinance, e.g., their spouses and employers.
As a member of the Minneapolis Civil Rights Commission, you are designated a local official by M.C.O. §15.280(m)(3). The claim of discrimination hearing is a particular matter that will have a direct or indirect effect on your financial interest in Making Money Company’s stock.  Your responsibilities as a hearing officer would require you to participate in the matter.
Your stock, valued at $15,000, is a financial interest that prevents you from assuming the hearing officer responsibilities.  If you sell your stock in Making Money Company so that its value is less than $2,500.00, you may accept these responsibilities.  By selling the stock, you have divested yourself of one of the financial interests that would cause a violation of the ordinance.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Three
Discussion continued:
Your daughter’s employment with Making Money Company is not a financial interest attributed to you under the ordinance, assuming she is not your dependent.  As discussed earlier in this training, only your financial interests and those of your employers and associated businesses, along with the financial interests of your dependents, your spouse or domestic partner and their employers and associated businesses are considered your financial interests.  Your emancipated daughter’s financial interests would not be considered your financial interests.
As your daughter is employed by another division of the company – not related to the matter being heard by the hearing panel – it is unlikely that your daughter will be testifying in the matter.  This should however be confirmed by the parties’ attorneys prior to the hearing and you should consider any objections to your participation in the matter.
Even if your daughter will not be involved in the hearing, you should consider several factors, including:
The importance of your role in the matter;
The sensitivity of the matter;
The information you have learned about the company from your daughter about the company that you would have difficulty setting aside; and
Whether a reasonable person might question your impartiality.
The City strives to have its officials avoid actions that might impair independence of judgment or give the appearance of impropriety or an appearance of a conflict of interest.  (See M.C.O. §15.20.) If after considering all of the facts, you determine that to maintain the highest ethical principles and avoid an apparent conflict of interest, you should recuse yourself from hearing the charge of discrimination.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Three

Discussion continued:
Should you decide not to sell your stock, you must disclose the conflict of interest to the other members of the Commission as soon as you become aware of the conflict of interest.  If you become aware of the conflict during a meeting, you must immediately disclose the conflict orally.  You must also complete the City’s conflict of interest form, describing the City matter and the nature of your conflict. The completed conflict of interest form is distributed to the other members of the Commission, the Mayor and City Council, any department head whose department or jurisdiction could be affected.  The completed form is also filed with the City Clerk.   You must refrain from discussing the matter with your fellow Commissioners and refrain participating from any Commission business regarding the matter.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Four

SCENARIO:  You are a member of the Public Health Advisory Committee.  You have a personal relationship and own a home with the owner of a consulting firm (“Firm”). The Committee is reviewing grant proposals to make recommendations about grant awards to the City Council.  A non-profit organization (“Help Others”) submitted a proposal listing the Firm as a provider of services which would be paid for with grant funds.  You also serve as a volunteer on another non-profit board (“Do Good”) and Do Good has also submitted a proposal seeking the grant money.
QUESTION: May you participate in the decision making process related to the recommendations to City Council regarding the grant proposals?
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Four

QUESTION: May you participate in the decision making process related to the recommendations to City Council regarding the grant proposals?
Please reflect first on the reason we have this conflict of interest statute and how it applies here. Then choose the best answer.
 Yes, provided Firm is not the sole provider of services listed in Helping Others’ proposal.
 No, because you have an interest in two of the proposals.
 Yes, because any interest you have in Helping Others is negated by the interest you have in Do Good.
Yes, provided you do not receive more than $50.00 compensation a month from Do Good.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Four
Discussion:

Correct!!
While the financial interests of a domestic partner are considered your financial interests, if the Firm is one of several possible providers of services, no conflict of interest exists. At the time of the board’s decision your financial interests are no any greater than the other providers of services listed
You may now proceed to the next page for a full discussion of the issue.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Four
Discussion:
Incorrect.  While the financial interests of a domestic partner are considered your financial interests, a potential conflict of interest involving the Firm would only arise if the Firm is listed as the sole provider of services.
Your volunteer service at Do Good does not create a conflict of interest because you are a volunteer.  Absent the payment of compensation of $50.00 per month or more, Do Good is not an associated business and you do not have a financial interest in Do Good.
Please return to the question and select another answer.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Four
Discussion:
Incorrect.  If you have a financial interest in a matter of city business, that interest can not be negated by another competing financial interest.

Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Four
Discussion:
Incorrect.   While it is correct that absent the payment of compensation of $50.00 per month or more, Do Good is not an associated business and you do not have a financial interest in Do Good, this answer ignores the financial interests of your domestic partner.

Please return to the question and select another answer.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Four

Discussion:

An associated business is one from which the official receives compensation of more than $50 in a month, or in which the official owns securities worth at least $2,500. Compensation does not include expense reimbursement.
A member serves without compensation as a board member of a grant proposer.
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Four
A member is compensated by, or owns securities in, a vendor named in a grant proposal as a sole provider of services which would be paid for with grant funds.
	A potential conflict of interest exists because the vendor named to be paid with grant funds is an associated business of the member based on payment of compensation or securities ownership. That vendor will benefit from the grant whereas other similarly situated vendors will not
A member is compensated by, or owns securities in, one of several possible vendors of training services which may be used by individuals and paid for with grant funds.
	No potential conflict of interest exists. The vendor is an associated business of the State Board member based on payment of compensation or securities ownership; however, to create a conflict of interest, it is necessary that the action under consideration "would substantially affect" the associated business [emphasis added]. A grant for training services which may or may not be provided by a particular vendor will not necessarily affect that vendor. Even if some individuals use the vendor for training, it is not possible to say at the time of the vote that the affect of the grant award on the vendor's financial interests would be substantial.
A member is compensated by, or owns securities in, an organization which is not named in a grant proposal, but which may benefit from the award of a particular grant.
	No potential conflict of interest exists. There is an associated business of the State Board member, based on payment of compensation or securities ownership. However, it cannot be said at the time of the vote that awarding the grant will have a substantial affect on the unnamed organization
Let’s now turn our attention to a new topic ~~ Disclosure of Information


Discussion Topic 2: Disclosure of Information

GENERAL RULE: You may not use or disclose any information gained in the course of or by reason of service to the City in any way that violates either your fiduciary duty to the City or the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act.  In addition, you may not use or disclose privileged, nonpublic, confidential, private, or proprietary information gained in the course of your official duties in any way that could result in financial gain for you, or for your spouse, domestic partner, or dependent, or for a person in a committed relationship with you, or for any associated business of these persons. M.C.O. § 15.170.
SCENARIO:  You are a member of the Rental Housing Board of Appeals.  Last year in the course of your service on the Board, you ruled on the suspension of Landlord’s rental license.  From the review of Landlord’s file you learned that Complainant was the source of the initial complaint forming the basis for the suspension of the rental license.  Last week you were at a friend’s party and starting chatting with Guest.  Guest was telling you about her rental properties and mentioned Complainant.  Guest’s rental properties are located in the same neighborhood as Landlord’s property.  According to Guest, Complainant is always calling Guest and threatening to file a complaint about the condition of her rental properties.  You warn Guest that Complainant will likely follow through with such threat and explain what happened when Complainant filed a complaint about Landlord.

QUESTION:  Was it permissible to share the information with Guest?

Yes, because you did not gain financially by informing Guest.
Yes, because the issue is completed and the matter closed.
No, because a complaint about Guest’s properties could be before the Board at a later date.
 No, because the identity of Complainant was private data.

Discussion Topic 2: Disclosure of Information

Discussion:
Incorrect.  It is correct that disclosure or use of certain information gained in the course of your service to the City in any way that could result in financial gain for you or the other persons or entities listed in this provision is a violation of the Ethics Code but a violation can also arise in situations where the disclosure or use does not result in financial gain.

Discussion:
Incorrect.  The discussion you are holding with Guest could require you to recuse yourself from a later hearing involving Guest’s properties but has no bearing on whether your disclosure of the information involving Landlord was proper.

Discussion Topic 2: Disclosure of Information

Discussion:

Correct!!  The Minnesota Government Data Practices Act classifies the identity of a Complainant as private data on an individual.  This means that the although the data is accessible to the Complainant, the data not accessible to the public.

Discussion Topic 2: Disclosure of Information

Discussion:

Members of the City’s boards and commissions will encounter non-public data through their work for the City.  It is important to keep the information non-public.  Even when you are not financially gaining from information, disclosure or use of non-public data that violate your fiduciary duty to the City and/or the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (“MGDPA”) violates the Ethics Code.  In addition to being an Ethics Code violation, a disclosure violating the MGDPA can result in legal actions by the subject of the data.  And a willful violation can result in exemplary damages of not less than $100, nor more than $10,000 for each violation.

It is important to take care to protect the non-public data you encounter in your role as a member of a City board or commission.  Occasionally, but not often, status of data changes based upon the status of a matter.  Always ask your staff liaison for assistance should you have any questions about the status of data.

SCENARIO:  You are a member of the Minneapolis Advisory Committee on People with Disabilities.  Each member has been tasked with inspecting the City’s restaurants and hotels for accessibility purposes.  When you arrive at Hotel, staff tells you that the General Manager is running a bit late, asks you to have a seat in the lobby and offers you a scone and coffee while you wait for the General Manager.

QUESTION:  Is it permissible to accept the scone and coffee?
REFLECTION:  How might it appear to a third party if you accept a gift from a prohibited source, even if you are properly accepting the gift under a listed exception?
Remember, we encourage you to use the analysis steps discussed earlier to select answers to the scenarios.

QUESTION:  Is it permissible to accept the scone and coffee?


Yes, because the intent behind the offer was one of common courtesy.
Yes, because the value of the scone and coffee is less than $5.00.
No, because your inspection could have an impact on the Hotel’s financial interests.
Yes, because the offer was from staff not from the General Manager.
Discussion Topic 3: Gifts

Discussion:
Incorrect.  It may well be that the gift is offered simply as a common courtesy with no intention to influence your inspection but if the gift is from a prohibited source, the gift must fall under an exception in order to be accepted.
Please return to the question and select another answer.
Discussion Topic 3: Gifts

Discussion:
Incorrect.  Not all gifts valued under $5.00 may be accepted.  This gift would not fit under any of the exceptions so even though it is of minimal value it may not be accepted if it is from a prohibited source.

No exceptions apply to a gift of scone and coffee as described in the scenario.  Food and beverage are never considered “services” or “trinkets or mementos”.  There is an exception that specifically addresses gifts of food or beverages, but it is quite limited in its application to event at which the recipient appears to make a speech or answer questions as part of a program.

Gifts to City officials pose a couple of risks.  One risk is that a gift will actually influence the official’s action on a matter.  The other risk is that the public will perceive the gift as having influenced the official’s action on the matter, regardless of whether the matter was actually influenced.

There is reason to be concerned with even small gifts.  Officials may rationalize that it is perfectly okay to accept such a small gift because everyone knows you can not be bought for a scone and coffee.  Sometimes that is the start of a very gradual but slippery slope.
When you are confronted with a gift from a prohibited source, you will want to consider carefully that even when a gift exception would allow you to accept the gift that it is never inappropriate and is frequently prudent to decline the gift because of your official position.
