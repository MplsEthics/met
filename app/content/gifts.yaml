### Incorrect.  Not all gifts valued under $5.00 may be accepted.  This gift would

### No exceptions apply to a gift of scone and coffee as described in the
### scenario.  Food and beverage are never considered “services” or “trinkets or
### mementos”.  There is an exception that specifically addresses gifts of food or
### beverages, but it is quite limited in its application to event at which the
### recipient appears to make a speech or answer questions as part of a program.

### rationalize that it is perfectly okay to accept such a small gift because
### everyone knows you can not be bought for a scone and coffee.  Sometimes that
### is the start of a very gradual but slippery slope.
### When you are confronted with a gift from a prohibited source, you will want to
### consider carefully that
