name: "Gifts"

scenario: "You are a member of the Minneapolis Advisory Committee on People
  with Disabilities.  Each member has been tasked with inspecting the
  City’s restaurants and hotels for accessibility purposes.  When you
  arrive at Hotel, staff tells you that the General Manager is running a
  bit late, asks you to have a seat in the lobby and offers you a scone and
  coffee while you wait for the General Manager."

question: "Is it permissible to accept the scone and coffee?"

prompt: "How might it appear to a third party if you accept a gift from a
  prohibited source, even if you are properly accepting the gift under a
  listed exception?  Remember, we encourage you to use the analysis steps
  discussed earlier to select answers to the scenarios."

--- !answer

answer: "Yes, because the intent behind the offer was one of common
  courtesy."

correct: false

response: "It may well be that the gift is offered simply as a common
  courtesy with no intention to influence your inspection but if the gift
  is from a prohibited source, the gift must fall under an exception in
  order to be accepted."

--- !answer

answer: "Yes, because the value of the scone and coffee is less than
  $5.00."

correct: false

response: "Not all gifts valued under $5.00 may be accepted.  This gift
  would not fit under any of the exceptions so even though it is of minimal
  value it may not be accepted if it is from a prohibited source."

--- !answer

answer: "No, because your inspection could have an impact on the Hotel’s
  financial interests."

correct: true

response: "The Hotel is an interested party.  The Hotel has a financial
  interest in the outcome of your inspection.  Should you report a
  deficiency, the Hotel will need to spend time and money to contest or
  remedy the deficiency."

--- !answer

answer: "Yes, because the offer was from staff not from the General
  Manager."

correct: false

response: "The gift is not provided by the staff in their personal capacity
  but on behalf of Hotel and Hotel has a financial interest in your
  inspection."
