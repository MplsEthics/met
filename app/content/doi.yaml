### j Discussion:
### j
### j Members of the City’s boards and commissions will encounter non-public data
### j through their work for the City.  It is important to keep the information
### j non-public.  Even when you are not financially gaining from information,
### j disclosure or use of non-public data that violate your fiduciary duty to the
### j City and/or the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (“MGDPA”) violates
### j the Ethics Code.  In addition to being an Ethics Code violation, a disclosure
### j violating the MGDPA can result in legal actions by the subject of the data.
### j And a willful violation can result in exemplary damages of not less than
### j $100, nor more than $10,000 for each violation.
### j
### j It is important to take care to protect the non-public data you encounter in
### j your role as a member of a City board or commission.  Occasionally, but not
### j often, status of data changes based upon the status of a matter.  Always ask
### j your staff liaison for assistance should you have any questions about the
### j status of data.
