CENARIO:  You are a member of the Public Health Advisory Committee.  You have
a personal relationship and own a home with the owner of a consulting firm
(“Firm”). The Committee is reviewing grant proposals to make recommendations
about grant awards to the City Council.  A non-profit organization (“Help
Others”) submitted a proposal listing the Firm as a provider of services which
would be paid for with grant funds.  You also serve as a volunteer on another
non-profit board (“Do Good”) and Do Good has also submitted a proposal seeking
the grant money.
QUESTION: May you participate in the decision making process related to the
recommendations to City Council regarding the grant proposals?
Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Four

QUESTION: May you participate in the decision making process related to the
recommendations to City Council regarding the grant proposals?
Please reflect first on the reason we have this conflict of interest statute
and how it applies here. Then choose the best answer.
 Yes, provided Firm is not the sole provider of services listed in Helping
 Others’ proposal.
  No, because you have an interest in two of the proposals.
   Yes, because any interest you have in Helping Others is negated by the
   interest you have in Do Good.
   Yes, provided you do not receive more than $50.00 compensation a month from
   Do Good.

   Discussion:

   Correct!!
   While the financial interests of a domestic partner are considered your
   financial interests, if the Firm is one of several possible providers of
   services, no conflict of interest exists. At the time of the board’s
   decision your financial interests are no any greater than the other
   providers of services listed

   Discussion:
   Incorrect.  While the financial interests of a domestic partner are
   considered your financial interests, a potential conflict of interest
   involving the Firm would only arise if the Firm is listed as the sole
   provider of services.
   Your volunteer service at Do Good does not create a conflict of interest
   because you are a volunteer.  Absent the payment of compensation of $50.00
   per month or more, Do Good is not an associated business and you do not
   have a financial interest in Do Good.

   Incorrect.  If you have a financial interest in a matter of city business,
   that interest can not be negated by another competing financial interest.

   Incorrect.   While it is correct that absent the payment of compensation of
   $50.00 per month or more, Do Good is not an associated business and you do
   not have a financial interest in Do Good, this answer ignores the financial
   interests of your domestic partner.

   An associated business is one from which the official receives compensation
   of more than $50 in a month, or in which the official owns securities worth
   at least $2,500. Compensation does not include expense reimbursement.
   A member serves without compensation as a board member of a grant proposer.
