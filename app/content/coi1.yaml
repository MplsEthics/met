name: 'Conflict of Interest, Part One'

scenario: "You, an architect, arrive for a Zoning Board of Adjustment
  meeting only to see a “Friend” standing in the hallway outside the
  meeting room.  Friend is present to plead his case for a variance.  Many
  neighborhood residents appearing to oppose Friend’s case are also
  standing in the hallway.  You “backslap” your friend with a hearty
  greeting.  Your employer initially worked on Friend’s project but Friend
  chose to finish the project with another Firm.  You never worked on
  Friend’s project because you specialize in other areas."

question: "May you participate in the Board’s decision related to Friend’s
  variance?"

prompt: "Please reflect first on the reason we have this conflict of
  interest statute and how it applies here. Then choose the best answer."

  indirect financial interest."

  financial interest in the matter."

id: "coi1.2"

answer: "Yes.  You may participate if you disclose the relationships to the
  other members of the Board prior to the action being taken."

correct: false

response: "Disclosure of a conflict of interest does not permit you to
  participate in a matter in which you have a conflict.  If your employer
  has a financial interest in the matter, then you are considered to have a
  conflict of interest and may not participate in the decision on Friend’s
  variance."

  outstanding bills.<p>There is a better answer, please try again."

id: "coi1.4"

  hearing the matter."
