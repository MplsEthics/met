  statute and how it applies here. Then choose the best answer."

  -
    answer: "Yes. You can hear this case because you have a high level of
      integrity and can assure the Chair that you will not let your stock
      ownership and your daughter’s employment influence you in making
      decisions on this case."
    response: "The fact that you are an honest person with a high level of
      personal integrity is not relevant.  The ordinance provides objective
      criteria.  The subjective factor of personal integrity is not included.
      The fact that you could make an objective and impartial decision based
      entirely on the facts presented in the hearing would not preclude you
      from violating the conflict of interest rule.  This is a good example of
      how even honest, well-meaning individuals may unwittingly violate the
      Ethics Code."
    correct: false

  -
    answer: "Maybe, if you sell the stock and determine that your relationship
      with your daughter and her employment will not affect your decisions in
      the case."
    response: "Selling the stock would eliminate your conflicting financial
      interest.  Your ability to assume the responsibilities of a member of
      the hearing panel would then depend on whether of not your participation
      in the matter would lead to an appearance of impropriety.  You may now
      proceed to a next page for a full discussion of the issue."
    correct: true

  -
    answer: "No, because your financial interest in the stock and your
      daughter’s employment preclude you from hearing the case."
    response: "While stock ownership does give you a financial interest that
      precludes you from serving on the hearing panel, there are actions that
      may be taken to remedy the conflict and allow you to participate.  There
      is a better answer, please try again."
    correct: false

  -
    answer: "Yes, if you sell your stock and disown your daughter."
    response: "Did you really think the City would require you to disown your
      child?  We’ve been accused of being heartless – but never like this.
      There is a better answer, please try again."
    correct: false
