name: "Conflict of Interest, Part Four"

scenario: "You are a member of the Public Health Advisory Committee.  You
  have a personal relationship and own a home with the owner of a
  consulting firm (“Firm”). The Committee is reviewing grant proposals to
  make recommendations about grant awards to the City Council.  A
  non-profit organization (“Help Others”) submitted a proposal listing the
  Firm as a provider of services which would be paid for with grant funds.
  You also serve as a volunteer on another non-profit board (“Do Good”) and
  Do Good has also submitted a proposal seeking the grant money."

question: "May you participate in the decision making process related to
  the recommendations to City Council regarding the grant proposals?"

prompt: "Please reflect first on the reason we have this conflict of
  interest statute and how it applies here. Then choose the best answer."

id: "coi4.1"

answer: "Yes, provided Firm is not the sole provider of services listed in
  Helping Others’ proposal."

correct: true

response: "While the financial interests of a domestic partner are
  considered your financial interests, if the Firm is one of several
  possible providers of services, no conflict of interest exists. At the
  time of the board’s decision your financial interests are no greater than
  the other providers of services listed."

id: "coi4.2"

answer: "No, because you have an interest in two of the proposals."

correct: false

response: "While the financial interests of a domestic partner are
  considered your financial interests, a potential conflict of interest
  involving the Firm would only arise if the Firm is listed as the sole
  provider of services.<p>Your volunteer service at Do Good does not create
  a conflict of interest because you are a volunteer.  Absent the payment
  of compensation of $50.00 per month or more, Do Good is not an associated
  business and you do not have a financial interest in Do Good."

id: "coi4.3"

answer: "Yes, because any interest you have in Helping Others is negated by
  the interest you have in Do Good."

correct: false

response: "If you have a financial interest in a matter of city business,
  that interest can not be negated by another competing financial
  interest."

--- !answer

id: "coi4.4"

answer: "Yes, provided you do not receive more than $50.00 compensation a
  month from Do Good."

correct: false

response: "While it is correct that absent the payment of compensation of
  $50.00 per month or more, Do Good is not an associated business and you
  do not have a financial interest in Do Good, this answer ignores the
  financial interests of your domestic partner."
