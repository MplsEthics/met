name: "Conflict of Interest, Part Three"

scenario: "A charge of discrimination has been filed by one of the former
  employees of Make Money Company.  The Chair of the Civil Rights Commission
  has informed you that you are on the panel assigned to hear the case.  You
  own $15,000 worth of stock in Make Money Company and your daughter is an
  executive with the company in a division not involved in the charge of
  discrimination."

question: "May you sit on the panel hearing the charge of discrimination?"

prompt: "Please reflect first on the reason we have this conflict of
  interest statute and how it applies here. Then choose the best answer."

id: "coi3.1"

answer: "Yes. You can hear this case because you have a high level of
  integrity and can assure the Chair that you will not let your stock
  ownership and your daughter’s employment influence you in making
  decisions on this case."

correct: false

response: "The fact that you are an honest person with a high level of
  personal integrity is not relevant.  The ordinance provides objective
  criteria.  The subjective factor of personal integrity is not included.
  The fact that you could make an objective and impartial decision based
  entirely on the facts presented in the hearing would not preclude you
  from violating the conflict of interest rule.  This is a good example of
  how even honest, well-meaning individuals may unwittingly violate the
  Ethics Code."

answer: "Maybe, if you sell the stock and determine that your relationship
  with your daughter and her employment will not affect your decisions in
  the case."

correct: true

response: "Selling the stock would eliminate your conflicting financial
  interest.  Your ability to assume the responsibilities of a member of
  the hearing panel would then depend on whether of not your participation
  in the matter would lead to an appearance of impropriety."

id: "coi3.3"

answer: "No, because your financial interest in the stock and your
  daughter’s employment preclude you from hearing the case."

correct: false

response: "While stock ownership does give you a financial interest that
  precludes you from serving on the hearing panel, there are actions that
  may be taken to remedy the conflict and allow you to participate.  There
  is a better answer, please try again."

--- !answer
id: "coi3.4"

answer: "Yes, if you sell your stock and disown your daughter."

correct: false

response: "Did you really think the City would require you to disown your
  child?  We’ve been accused of being heartless&mdash;but never like this.
  There is a better answer, please try again."
