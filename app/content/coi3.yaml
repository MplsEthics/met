name: 'conflict-of-interest'

scenario: "A charge of discrimination has been filed by one of the former
  employees of Make Money Company.  The Chair of the Civil Rights Commission
  has informed you that you are on the panel assigned to hear the case.  You
  own $15,000 worth of stock in Make Money Company and your daughter is an
  executive with the company in a division not involved in the charge of
  discrimination."

prompt: "Please reflect first on the reason we have this conflict of interest
  statute and how it applies here. Then choose the best answer."

stem: "May you sit on the panel hearing the charge of discrimination?"

answers:

  - !answer
    answer: "Yes. You can hear this case because you have a high level of
      integrity and can assure the Chair that you will not let your stock
      ownership and your daughter’s employment influence you in making
      decisions on this case."
    response: "The fact that you are an honest person with a high level of
      personal integrity is not relevant.  The ordinance provides objective
      criteria.  The subjective factor of personal integrity is not included.
      The fact that you could make an objective and impartial decision based
      entirely on the facts presented in the hearing would not preclude you
      from violating the conflict of interest rule.  This is a good example of
      how even honest, well-meaning individuals may unwittingly violate the
      Ethics Code."
    correct: false

  - !answer
    answer: "Maybe, if you sell the stock and determine that your relationship
      with your daughter and her employment will not affect your decisions in
      the case."
    response: "Selling the stock would eliminate your conflicting financial
      interest.  Your ability to assume the responsibilities of a member of
      the hearing panel would then depend on whether of not your participation
      in the matter would lead to an appearance of impropriety.  You may now
      proceed to a next page for a full discussion of the issue."
    correct: true

  - !answer
    answer: "No, because your financial interest in the stock and your
      daughter’s employment preclude you from hearing the case."
    response: "While stock ownership does give you a financial interest that
      precludes you from serving on the hearing panel, there are actions that
      may be taken to remedy the conflict and allow you to participate.  There
      is a better answer, please try again."
    correct: false

  - !answer
    answer: "Yes, if you sell your stock and disown your daughter."
    response: "Did you really think the City would require you to disown your
      child?  We’ve been accused of being heartless – but never like this.
      There is a better answer, please try again."
    correct: false
