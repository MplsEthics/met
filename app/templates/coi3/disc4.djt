<p>
Should you decide not to sell your stock, you must disclose the conflict of
interest to the other members of the Commission as soon as you become aware of
the conflict of interest.  If you become aware of the conflict during a
meeting, you must immediately disclose the conflict orally.

<p>
You must also complete the Cityâ€™s conflict of interest form, describing the
City matter and the nature of your conflict. The completed conflict of
interest form is distributed to the other members of the Commission, the Mayor
and City Council, any department head whose department or jurisdiction could
be affected.  The completed form is also filed with the City Clerk.

<p>
You must refrain from discussing the matter with your fellow Commissioners and
refrain participating from any Commission business regarding the matter.
