Yes. You can hear this case because you have a high level of integrity and can
assure the Chair that you will not let your stock ownership and your
daughter’s employment influence you in making decisions on this case.
Maybe, if you sell the stock and determine that your relationship with your
daughter and her employment will not affect your decisions in the case.
No, because your financial interest in the stock and your daughter’s
employment preclude you from hearing the case.
Yes, if you sell your stock and disown your daughter.
