  Commission.  A subcommittee of the NCEC has been tasked with working with
  the City to hire a Director for the Neighborhood and Community Relations
  Department.  The subcommittee will be selecting the finalists and making
  recommendations on hiring.  The City Coordinator will make the final
  decision on the hiring of a director.  You have been invited to coffee at
  a local restaurant by Acquaintance who is interested in your work on the
  NCEC and you accept.  During your meeting you have coffee and a scone.
  During your meeting, Acquaintance tells you that she has applied for the
  Director position.  You inform Acquaintance that you are on the selection
  committee and can not discuss that topic with her.  When the server
  brings the bill, Acquaintance insists on paying."

answer: "Yes, because the intent behind the offer was one of common
  courtesy."

  courtesy with no intention to influence your inspection but if the gift
  is from a prohibited source, the gift must fall under an exception in
  order to be accepted."

id: 'gifts.2'

answer: "Yes, because the value of the scone and coffee is less than
  $5.00."

correct: false

response: "Not all gifts valued under $5.00 may be accepted.  This gift
  would not fit under any of the exceptions so even though it is of minimal
  value it may not be accepted if it is from a prohibited source."

  recommendations.   Coffee and scones do not fall within any of the listed
