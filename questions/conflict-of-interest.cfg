[Conflict of Interest]

scenario: Your supervisor has asked you to be the Contracting Officer's
  Representative (COR) on a contract with Defense Mania Corporation. This
  position would involve tasking the contractor and monitoring its
  deliverables.  You own $20,000 worth of stock in Defense Mania, and your
  spouse is employed by the company in a division that is not involved in
  the work for your agency.

question: May you take on these new COR responsibilities?

correct-answer: 1

answer[0]: Yes. You can take on these COR duties because you have a
  high level of integrity and can assure your supervisor that you will not
  let either your stock ownership or your spouse's employment influence you
  in making decisions on this contract.

answer[1]: Maybe, if you sell the stock and determine that your actions
  could not affect your spouse's salary and benefits.

answer[2]: No, because your financial interest in the stock and in your
  spouse's employment and salary preclude you from taking on these
  responsibilities.

answer[3]: Yes, if you sell your stock and divorce your spouse.
