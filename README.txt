Description
===========

This package contains a complete Google App Engine application suitable for
basic municipal ethics training, including the following topics:

   - Conflict of Interest
   - Disclosure of Information
   - Gifts

Each topic contains one or more sample 'scenarios', each having a question
that must be answered correctly before proceeding to the next scenario.  At
the end of the training, a user may enter contact information and submit
proof of completion to a central location.

This training is modeled after the 2007 US DOD Annual Ethics Training
module.
