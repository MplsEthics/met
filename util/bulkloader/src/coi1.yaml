id: "coi1"

name: "Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part One"

scenario: "You, an architect and a member of the Zoning Board of
  Adjustment, arrive for a board meeting only to see a “Friend” standing in
  the hallway outside the meeting room.  Friend is present to plead his
  case for a variance.  Many neighborhood residents appearing to oppose
  Friend's case are also standing in the hallway.  You “backslap” your
  friend with a hearty greeting.  Your employer initially worked on
  Friend's project but Friend chose to finish the project with another
  Firm.  You never worked on Friend’s project because you specialize in
  other areas."

question: "May you participate in the Board’s decision related to
  Friend’s variance?"

prompt: "Please reflect first on the reason we have this conflict of
  interest statute and how it applies here. Then choose the best
  answer."

answers:
  - !answer
    id: "coi1.1"
    answer: "Yes.  You may participate if your employer has no direct or
      indirect financial interest."
    is_correct: true
    response: "Your employer’s financial interests are considered your
      financial interests.  If your employer has no business relationship
      with the party appearing before the Board, your employer, and you,
      have no financial interest in the matter."

  - !answer
    id: "coi1.2"
    answer: "Yes.  You may participate if you disclose the relationships to
      the other members of the Board prior to the action being taken."
    is_correct: false
    response: "Disclosure of a conflict of interest does not permit you to
      participate in a matter in which you have a conflict.  If your
      employer has a financial interest in the matter, then you are
      considered to have a conflict of interest and may not participate in
      the decision on Friend’s variance."

  - !answer
    id: "coi1.3"
    answer: "Yes.  You may participate because your employer is not
      involved and you are not related to Friend."
    is_correct: false
    response: "This answer would be correct <b>only if</b> your Friend and
      your Employer have concluded all business between them, including
      payment of outstanding bills.<p>There is a better answer, please try
      again."

  - !answer
    id: "coi1.4"
    answer: "No.  You may not participate because of your relationship with
      Friend."
    is_correct: false
    response: "Financial interests of friends are not considered your
      financial interests, so your relationship with Friend would not
      preclude you from hearing the matter."
