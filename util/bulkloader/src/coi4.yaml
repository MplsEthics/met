id: "coi4"

name: "Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Four"

scenario: "You are a member of the Public Health Advisory Committee.  You
  have a personal relationship and own a home with the owner of a
  consulting firm (“Firm”). The Committee is reviewing grant proposals to
  make recommendations about grant awards to the City Council.  A
  non-profit organization (“Help Others”) submitted a proposal listing the
  Firm as a provider of services which would be paid for with grant funds.
  You also serve as a volunteer on another non-profit board (“Do Good”) and
  Do Good has also submitted a proposal seeking the grant money."

question: "May you participate in the decision making process related to
  the recommendations to City Council regarding the grant proposals?"

prompt: "Please reflect first on the reason we have this conflict of
  interest statute and how it applies here. Then choose the best answer."

answers:

  - !answer
    id: "coi4.1"
    answer: "Yes, provided Firm is not the sole provider of services listed in
      Helping Others’ proposal."
    is_correct: true
    response: "While the financial interests of a domestic partner are
      considered your financial interests, if the Firm is one of several
      possible providers of services, no conflict of interest exists. At
      the time of the board’s decision your financial interests are no
      greater than the other providers of services listed."

  - !answer
    id: "coi4.2"
    answer: "No, because you have an interest in two of the proposals."
    is_correct: false
    response: "While the financial interests of a domestic partner are
      considered your financial interests, a potential conflict of interest
      involving the Firm would only arise if the Firm is listed as the sole
      provider of services.<p>Your volunteer service at Do Good does not
      create a conflict of interest because you are a volunteer.  Absent
      the payment of compensation of $50.00 per month or more, Do Good is
      not an associated business and you do not have a financial interest
      in Do Good."

  - !answer
    id: "coi4.3"
    answer: "Yes, because any interest you have in Helping Others is
      negated by the interest you have in Do Good."
    is_correct: false
    response: "If you have a financial interest in a matter of city
      business, that interest can not be negated by another competing
      financial interest."

  - !answer
    id: "coi4.4"
    answer: "Yes, provided you do not receive more than $50.00 compensation
      a month from Do Good."
    is_correct: false
    response: "While it is correct that absent the payment of compensation
      of $50.00 per month or more, Do Good is not an associated business
      and you do not have a financial interest in Do Good, this answer
      ignores the financial interests of your domestic partner."
