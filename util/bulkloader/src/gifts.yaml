name: "Topic Three: Gifts"

scenario: "You are a member of the Neighborhood & Community Engagement
  Commission.  A subcommittee of the NCEC has been tasked with working with
  the City to hire a Director for the Neighborhood and Community Relations
  Department.  The subcommittee will be selecting the finalists and making
  recommendations on hiring.  The City Coordinator will make the final
  decision on the hiring of a director.  You have been invited to coffee at
  a local restaurant by Acquaintance who is interested in your work on the
  NCEC and you accept.  During your meeting you have coffee and a scone.
  During your meeting, Acquaintance tells you that she has applied for the
  Director position.  You inform Acquaintance that you are on the selection
  committee and can not discuss that topic with her.  When the server
  brings the bill, Acquaintance insists on paying."

question: "Is it permissible to accept Acquaintance's offer to pay for your
  scone and coffee?"

prompt: ""

answers:

  - !answer

    id: 'gifts.1'
    answer: "Yes, because the intent behind the offer was one of common
      courtesy."
    is_correct: false
    response: "It may well be that the gift is offered simply as a common
      courtesy with no intention to influence your inspection but if the
      gift is from a prohibited source, the gift must fall under an
      exception in order to be accepted."

  - !answer

    id: 'gifts.2'
    answer: "Yes, because the value of the scone and coffee is less than
      $5.00."
    is_correct: false
    response: "Not all gifts valued under $5.00 may be accepted.  This gift
      would not fit under any of the exceptions so even though it is of
      minimal value it may not be accepted if it is from a prohibited
      source."

  - !answer

    id: 'gifts.3'
    answer: "No, because of your role on the subcommittee and Acquaintance's
      financial interests."
    is_correct: true
    response: "Acquaintance is an interested party.  Acquaintance has a
      financial interest in the outcome of the subcommittee's hiring
      recommendations.   Coffee and scones do not fall within any of the
      listed gift exceptions."

  - !answer

    id: 'gifts.4'
    answer: "Yes, because the subcommittee is not the final decision maker
      and you did not discuss the matter with Acquaintance."
    is_correct: false
    response: "Even though the subcommittee is not the final decision
      maker, the subcommittee's recommendations will directly impact
      Acquaintance's status as a contender for the Director position.
      Acquaintance is an interested person."
