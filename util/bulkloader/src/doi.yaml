name: "Topic Two: Disclosure of Information"

scenario: "You are a member of the Rental Housing Board of Appeals.  Last
  year in the course of your service on the Board, you ruled on the
  suspension of Landlord’s rental license.  From the review of Landlord’s
  file you learned that Complainant was the source of the initial complaint
  forming the basis for the suspension of the rental license.  Last week
  you were at a friend’s party and starting chatting with Guest.  Guest was
  telling you about her rental properties and mentioned Complainant.
  Guest’s rental properties are located in the same neighborhood as
  Landlord’s property.  According to Guest, Complainant is always calling
  Guest and threatening to file a complaint about the condition of her
  rental properties.  You warn Guest that Complainant will likely follow
  through with such threat and explain what happened when Complainant
  filed a complaint about Landlord."

question: "Was it permissible to share the information with Guest?"

prompt: ""

answers:

    id: "doi.1"
    answer: "Yes, because you did not gain financially by informing Guest."
    is_correct: false
    response: "While your disclosure did not result in financial gain for
      you or the other persons or entities listed in M.C.O. § 15.170, a
      violation can also arise in situations where the disclosure is of
      nonpublic information."

  - !answer

    id: "doi.2"
    answer: "Yes, because the issue is completed and the matter closed."
    is_correct: false
    response: "The answer to this question does not depend on the status of the
      matter but the status of the information used or disclosed."

  - !answer

    id: "doi.3"
    answer: "No, because a complaint about Guest’s properties could be before
      the Board at a later date."
    is_correct: false
    response: "The discussion you are holding with Guest could require you
      to recuse yourself from a later hearing involving Guest’s properties
      but has no bearing on whether your disclosure of the information
      involving Landlord was proper."

  - !answer

    id: "doi.4"
    answer: "No, because you identified Complainant as the complaining
      party in Landlord's matter."
    is_correct: true
    response: "The Minnesota Government Data Practices Act classifies the
      identity of a Complainant as private data on an individual.  This
      means that although the data is accessible to the Complainant, the
      data is not accessible to the public."
