  Housing Maintenance Code.  You received an order from a housing inspector
  regarding a rental property you own.  You want to appeal the order."

question: "May you appeal an order issued by city staff when the appeal
  will be heard by a board on which you are a member?"

  interest statute and how it applies here. Then choose the best answer."

      date."

      pursue personal business with the City and may appeal a housing order
      to the Board."

      rights held by other Minneapolis citizens."
