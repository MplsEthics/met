id: 'coi3'

name: "Topic One: Conflict of Interest, Part Three"

scenario: "A charge of discrimination has been filed by one of the former
  employees of Make Money Company.  The Chair of the Civil Rights
  Commission has informed you that you are on the panel assigned to hear
  the case.  You own $15,000 worth of stock in Make Money Company and your
  daughter is an executive with the company in a division not involved in
  the charge of discrimination."

question: "May you sit on the panel hearing the charge of discrimination?"

prompt: "Please reflect first on the reason we have this conflict of
  interest statute and how it applies here. Then choose the best answer."

answers:

  - !answer
    id: "coi3.1"
    answer: "Yes. You can hear this case because you have a high level of
      integrity and can assure the Chair that you will not let your stock
      ownership and your daughter’s employment influence you in making
      decisions on this case."
    is_correct: false
    response: "The fact that you are an honest person with a high level of
      personal integrity is not relevant. <p>The ordinance provides
      objective criteria.  The subjective factor of personal integrity is
      not included.  The fact that you could make an objective and
      impartial decision based entirely on the facts presented in the
      hearing would not preclude you from violating the conflict of
      interest rule. <p>This is a good example of how even honest,
      well-meaning individuals may unwittingly violate the Ethics Code."

  - !answer
    id: "coi3.2"
    answer: "Maybe, if you sell the stock and determine that your
      relationship with your daughter and her employment will not affect
      your decisions in the case."
    is_correct: true
    response: "Selling the stock would eliminate your conflicting financial
      interest.  <p>Your ability to assume the responsibilities of a member
      of the hearing panel would then depend on whether of not your
      participation in the matter would lead to an appearance of
      impropriety."

  - !answer
    id: "coi3.3"
    answer: "No, because your financial interest in the stock and your
      daughter’s employment preclude you from hearing the case."
    is_correct: false
    response: "While stock ownership does give you a financial interest
      that precludes you from serving on the hearing panel, there are
      actions that may be taken to remedy the conflict and allow you to
      participate. <p>There is a better answer, please try again."

  - !answer
    id: "coi3.4"
    answer: "Yes, if you sell your stock and disown your daughter."
    is_correct: false
    response: "Did you really think the City would require you to disown
      your child? <p>The Ethics Code sets high standards but does not
      require unreasonable remedies. <p>There is a better answer, please
      try again."
