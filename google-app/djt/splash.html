Ethics in Government Education for Appointed Members of Boards, Commissions and
Agencies

Office of the Minneapolis City Attorney

Welcome to the Ethics in Government Education for Appointed Members of Boards,
Commissions and Agencies.  This training module consists of a General Overview
of the City of Minneapolis Ethics in Government Ordinance, followed by three
discussion topics, a discussion of the Confidential Reporting Line, and a
summary.  The discussion topics are as follows:

    1. Conflict of Interest
    2. Gifts
    3. Use of City Property

We expect that, on average, this training should take approximately 30 minutes.
Upon completion, you will have finished your required ethics education for the
four year time period and will be more comfortable with some of the measures to
ensure integrity in Minneapolis City government.
